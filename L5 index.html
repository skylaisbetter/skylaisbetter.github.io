 <h1>All About Skyla</h1>

  <h3>Before BECA</h3>
   <em><p>Before beca I did not hate school as much as I do now:).
<br></br>
  I was in online school before hand so I was kinda excited to be back in school. 
<br></br>
    Remote learning was really boring and I did not learn anything.</p></em>

  <h3>During BECA</h3>
   <em><p> I was excited for BECA until I found out they did things like uniform, yonder pouches, and classes.
<br></br>
  It still feels like middle school. </p></em>

  <h3>After BECA</h3>
   <p><strong><em>I cannot wait to finish highschool.</em></strong>
<br></br>
   <em>Hopefully I'll be going to college by then.</em></p>
