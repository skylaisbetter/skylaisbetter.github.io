<h2>Artifact #1</h2>
<img src="my animals 2.png" width="200" height="200" alt="cow with a horse head and wings"/>
<p>This is a animal with a cow body, horse head, and eagle wings. I made this by cropping the photos, erasing the backgrounds, and merging the photos together.</p>
<h2>Artifact #2</h2>
<img src="colorful faces.png" width="353" height="458" alt="colorful morphed squares with faces"/>
	<p>These are weird faced people that I made. The faces started off as a square but I morphed the right side to my liking and copied it to the left side, then I morphed the top and copied it to the bottom. By doing so I made a shape that fits perfectly with itself. I then made a face and added color and this was the finished result. </p>
<h2>Artifact #3</h2>
	<img src="laceless shoes.png" width="277" height="277" alt="vans with converse logo and no laces"/>
	<p>In this lesson we were practicing using vectors. We had to create our own shoes... I decided to make a combination of a vans and converse shoe</p>
<h2>Artifact #4</h2>
<img src="filtered panda.png" width="339" height="200" alt="panda"/>
	<p>This is a baby panda with a filter on it. We were practing using the filter feature.</p>
